# Preface

This week, I have been over the deepest and darkest corners of the web--no that's a lie. I just learnt about operating systems and how secure they are.

As boring and simple as they would seem to the average user, to the ones that are willing to explore, us, operating systems provide a much higher level of complexion than it would seem. They are quite the magnificient creation, bridging the gap between a chaotic structure of metal and the abstraction of applications. Throughout the week, I went on to learn more about what these inctricate, yet intuitive, pieces of engineering do for the regular user and what that means for us as the cyber students. 

# Purpose of Operating Systems

Why would you want to have an operating system for your computer? Why do you need an intermediarity stage between the computer hardware and applications? Why is it that you can't run programs directly on the hardware? Truth is, you don't *need* an operating system, but having an operating system makes life a whole lot simpler for both the developers of applications and the user on the computer.

To know why the operating system is so essential for everyone to have, let's have a look at some security-related tasks that it undertakes:

# The Security Aspect

Since the operating system manages; and therefore, filters all of the data that is provided by the applications before passing it on the the hardware. The operating system is able to perform security measures to prevent misuse of the hardware by an application. As you can imagine, free reign over a machine would definitely lead to extreme exploitation of computers. The operating system, specifically looks for potential threats to the hardware that come from applications; these can be: Malware detection and prevention, like stopping buffer-overflow attacks; Authentication, like asking for your password when logging in; Firewalls, like stopping worms from spreading; and many more features.

There are so many security measures that are placed by the operating system to prevent the unauthorized use of the hardware from a rogue application.

## The Big Three

### Windows 10

Ah yes, Windows. Well, since you're on this blog, chances are that you know what Windows is. Regardless, I'll be decribing it to you for the millionth time. Windows 10 is the most used operating system throughout the world from when it released in 2015. As you can expect, this is also the most targetted operating system by unethical security professionals (hackers) since most users of windows don't know what an operating system is or what operating system be. It is also the least secure of the three we will cover with the least attentiveness to security patches. Even when they do come, they come in the most unconveinient form of the three we'll be covering.

*[RANT WARNING]* The updates impair your system for many hours; they come on the second tuesday of every month and contain the security patches. Despite these security patches, Microsoft has been known to have purposeful backdoors in their system; Microsoft came to reveal this when the WannaCry ransomware spread like crazy through the internet in 2017. 

### macOS

MacOS is the shadow side of Linux. Designed to be beneficial to the general public with a concentration in aiding the artistic professions. It's not the shadow side because its so fancy with its artistic abilities, but rather because macOS is closed-source and only available to its full extent for people that have macbooks while Linux is completely open for anyone to use. MacOS is the second most used operating system in the world and with its popularity, come the unethical security professionals that want to steal data. Although not the most secure, Apple definitely does a better job than Windows in keeping your data safe. Apple is also superior is keeping your privacy as Windows has telemetry built into their OS while macOS gives you the option to opt-out of their telemetry.

### Linux

I feel kinda odd placing this in its own section. It really should have sections within itself; therefore, sections:

#### Debian

This version of Linux is the one that people with separation anxiety use. Okay, not really, but it is the one that will keep one of the most stable relationships with the user. Debian is the most prominent distribution to be used in Linux when it comes to servers. The stability that Debian's release 'Debian Stable' provides is unparalleled with most other operating systems and distributions other than Red Hat Linux. As with many stable distributions, one factor that is common is that the versions have to stripped down quite far to prevent unexpected failures and zero day attacks.



#### Arch


#### Red Hat
